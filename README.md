# Vancouver Airbnb - Understanding the data

## Motivation

This project aims to answer some questions that existing, or potential, AirBnB hosts may have about pricing their listing in Vancouver. We examine three main questions:

1. How do listing prices vary by date and location?
2. Are review scores reflected in prices?
3. What features and amenities are important to the price of a listing?
